# Working with Files and Error Handling Exceptions

Error handling is the important concept of this class.

## Topics 
This class will cover: 
- error handling
- excptions 
- using `try` and `except`
- best practices using `with`
- clean up our functions with `finally`
- open, closing and writing to files 

## Error Handling
What can go wrong will go wrong

Assume your code will break, and what you want to do is handle the errors, gracefully.

When you handle your errors, your code will continue to run.


## Best Practices

#### never capture all exceptions 
You never want to handle for **ALL EXCEPTION** because it can create an unstopable code. 

You must specify what exception you want to handle:

```python
try:
    file = open('order.txt')
except FileNotFoundError
    print('THERE HAS BEEN AN ERROR! PANIC NOW!')
``` 

#### Capture your message

You can capture your messages using `as`:

```python
try:
    file = open('order.txt')
except FileNotFoundError as error_message:
    # print('THERE HAS BEEN AN ERROR! PANIC NOW!')
```
